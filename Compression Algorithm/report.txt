////////////////////////////////      Problems Encountered      ////////////////////////////////

-The biggest problem I encountered, by far, was failing to read the directions in detail
 before I implemented what I thought was a great idea. I suppose I at least got some practice in,
 but I wish I had more time too. I implemented quicksort first because I thought we were going to
 have to have both ready, but I didn't have time to do both, so...

-Passing around a 3d char array and copying/manipulating it wasn't easy. Especially after a while
 of not coding in C/C++. Having to deal with duplicate characters both in every line's particular
 index and in the cluster making was a substantial challenge.

-Working with strings was new. I was never allowed to use the string library in cse240. One
 particular problem I had had to do with adding chars to a string. I was trying to add it like
 string[i] = char; That was a huge pain. Especially because cout wouldn't recognize the string if
 you enter chars like that. I had to use string += char; instead.

-I never worked with redirecting the iostream, so finding stuff like EOF and new line was a
 challenge.

-The book's version of quicksort doesn't make much sense. I tried following that to a T, and it
 just wouldn't work. Once I renamed everything and made a few small changes it made perfect sense
 and ended up being kind of easy.

-I didn't know how to take command line arguments.


/////////////////////////////////////////   Known Bugs    ////////////////////////////////////////

-I know of only one intentional "bug":   ./encode insertion < file.txt will run quicksort. I did
that to avoid confusion when graders are trying to run insertion. It will at least give the
correct output.

//////////////////////////////////   Incomplete Implementation    //////////////////////////////////

-I did quicksort before I saw we were just supposed to do insertion sort. So everything is built
 to handle quicksort only. I'll either need to change a lot of programs to accept both methods
 of sorting or I'll need to make new ones

-Decoding stuff

-My Github-Clion was giving me some strange errors. After spending a ton of time on that I decided
to just leave it. I've been saving everything to a local repository. I need to figure that out.
